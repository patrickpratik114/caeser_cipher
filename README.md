# caeser_cipher
**This is a simple python project where we can make understand how caeser cipher works. Caeser cipher is an ancient ciphering techniques where the initial message is shifted according to numbers. Let's take an example to properly understand this term.**
**Initial Message = "Hello I am Pratik Shrestha"** 
**Shift Value = 5**
**Ciphered Text = mjqqt n fr uwfynp xmwjxymf**

**The Ciphered Text is sent along with shift number to properly decode the message**

**In the project write 'encode' to encrypt your message. If you want to decrypt the given cipher write 'decode'**

**You can begin try out by decoding "znoy oy cuxqotm' with shift number "6"**
